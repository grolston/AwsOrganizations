Macie is a service that looks at categorizing and identifying sensitive data stored in S3. The service is an AWS Organization integrated service allowing it to be centrally managed across your environment from one account. Centralized management of Macie enables automatic deployment and configuration for current and new accounts. Macie is a regional service, meaning you would need to configure the centralized management within your delegated account per applicable region.

> **Recommendation:** Delegate the service to your dedicated SOC AWS account
